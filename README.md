# Sift

**Your personal agent in the trenches.**

Sift is a Telegram-first project for personalised memecoin
discovery and monitoring.

The goal is to help traders spend less time searching for
tokens, repeating screening checks, and monitoring wallet
activity across different tools.

Bot: [@SiftAgentbot](https://t.me/SiftAgentbot)

## Current status

Sift is at the beginning of development.

The Telegram bot has been registered through BotFather.
The bot implementation, hosting, market-data integrations,
and AI integration have not yet been built or configured.

Features described below are planned, not currently available.

The first milestone is simple: send `/start` and receive a
welcome message from Sift.

## How Sift will work

1. Describe the tokens you want to find in everyday language.
2. Answer targeted questions about unclear instructions.
3. Review measurable screening rules and their limitations.
4. Approve and activate your agent.
5. Receive alerts when tokens satisfy your strict requirements.
6. Choose tokens to monitor for relevant changes.

AI will interpret instructions and explain findings.
Explicit rules will evaluate actual market and blockchain data.

## Planned first-version features

### Personalised discovery

Configure screening conditions such as token age, market cap,
liquidity, trading activity, and holder metrics where reliable
data is available.

Separate strict requirements from warning-only checks.
Changes to active rules will require user approval.

### Evidence-backed Telegram alerts

Alerts will include:

- Token name, symbol, chain, and full contract address.
- Reasons the token qualified.
- Relevant metrics and measurement windows.
- Detected concerns and unknown checks.
- Time checked and data freshness.
- Supporting source or transaction links.
- Controls to monitor, dismiss, or mute the token.

### Follow-up monitoring

Monitor selected tokens and wallets with supported deployer
attribution.

Report verified sales, transfers, and uncertain activity
separately. Track approved liquidity changes and relevant
screening-condition changes where the data supports them.

### Simple controls

Provide help, status, edit, pause, resume, and stop controls.
Preserve user settings and monitoring state across restarts.

## Proposed initial scope

These choices remain provisional:

- Solana as the first supported chain.
- One named agent per user.
- Private testing with the owner before invited testers.
- Free access during validation.
- A 24-hour monitoring period with extend and stop options.

Screening thresholds will be chosen by users.
Example strategies will not become silent defaults.

## Data and evidence principles

- Missing information is unknown, never an invented value.
- Unknown results cannot pass strict requirements.
- Live, cached, mock, and unsupported data are distinguished.
- Market cap and fully diluted valuation are labelled separately.
- Token creation and the start of trading are distinct events.
- Discovery sources, venue coverage, and freshness are disclosed.
- Suspected wallet coordination is not presented as proof.
- Unsupported bundle analysis is explicitly labelled.
- Service failures and monitoring interruptions are visible.

## Development roadmap

- [ ] Basic Telegram response and private tester access.
- [ ] Durable user settings and agent state.
- [ ] Real token-data checks and evidence validation.
- [ ] Conversational setup and rule approval.
- [ ] One complete discovery-to-alert flow.
- [ ] Follow-up monitoring and event classification.
- [ ] Reliability testing and invited-user validation.

Each stage should report what works, what was tested,
and what remains incomplete.

## Later possibilities

- Website dashboard.
- Additional chains.
- Multiple agents per user.
- Advanced wallet clustering and bundle investigation.
- Preference learning from feedback.
- Periodic summaries.
- Paid subscriptions.

## Development setup

The technology stack, hosting, and data providers are still
being evaluated. Setup instructions will be added with the
first runnable implementation.

Credentials must remain outside source control, chat, and logs.

## Product boundaries

Sift will not connect to trading wallets, hold funds, request
private keys, or execute trades.

A token matching screening conditions does not establish
safety or predict profit. Users remain responsible for their
research and trading decisions.
